Blood Drips and Paint Splats.

Provided in this pack are 3 texture pages, each control various
aspects such as Masking, Base Color Value and Normal Maps for the
bump.

The textures are 8*8 squares left to right. Just like a sprite sheet.
The Animation of the texture can be controlled by the Animation Speed.
If this is set to 0, you can set the actual frame 0-63 via the Animation
Frame slider. A Normal map power slider lets you alter the overall bump effect.

Supposedly you could also control this via a script so that it can be used in other ways.
